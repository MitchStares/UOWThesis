University of Wollongong PhD Thesis Rmarkdown Template
========================

This repository provides a template for a UOW University PhD thesis using Rmarkdown with the bookdown package. It is designed for PhD students in the Faculty of Science, Medicine and Health. This has been modified from the Monash University template from Professor Rob Hyndman.

## Requirements

To set up the software, you will need to install the `bookdown` package and its dependencies as follows:

```r
install.packages('bookdown')
```

You will also need LaTeX installed. If you don't already have LaTeX, one convenient approach is to install it via R:

```r
install.packages('tinytex')
tinytex::install_tinytex()
```
